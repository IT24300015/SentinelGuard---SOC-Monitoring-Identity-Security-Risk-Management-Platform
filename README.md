🛡️ SentinelGuard — SOC Monitoring, Identity Security & Risk Management Platform

📌 Project Overview

SentinelGuard is an end-to-end Security Operations Center (SOC) platform that simulates a real company security environment. The system monitors Windows devices, collects security logs, detects suspicious activities, analyzes employee identities and password risks, generates alerts, investigates incidents, and produces security reports.

The main goal is to detect security threats early and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and cyberattacks.

This project combines three cybersecurity domains into one platform:


🔵 SOC Monitoring — Real-time log collection, SIEM alerting, and threat detection
🟡 Identity Security — Simulated employee accounts, access management, risk scoring
🔴 Risk Management — Password auditing, attack simulation, incident investigation



⭐ This is a strong, complete portfolio project for an entry-level SOC Analyst resume.

🚨 Recommendations (from Final Report)

Immediate Actions


🔴 Force password reset for rwilson and jcarter — both cracked in under 20 seconds
🔴 Enable account lockout: lock after 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout duration
🔴 Enforce minimum password length of 14 characters
🔴 Restrict SMB access (port 445) via Windows Firewall


Short-Term (Within 30 Days)


🟡 Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee accounts
🟡 Implement password complexity policy banning dictionary words and sequential numbers
🟡 Conduct monthly password audits using John the Ripper


Long-Term


🟢 Expand Splunk monitoring to include network-level events (DNS, firewall logs)
🟢 Implement Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution
🟢 Add anomaly-based detection (baseline normal behaviour, alert on deviations)
🟢 Schedule quarterly red team exercises
🟢 Deploy EDR solution for deeper endpoint visibility
